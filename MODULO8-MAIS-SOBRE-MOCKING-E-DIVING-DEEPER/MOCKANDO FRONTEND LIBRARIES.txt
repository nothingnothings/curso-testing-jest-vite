In this example project, the global fetch() API / function is used.

You can, of course, also use third-party libraries
 in frontend JavaScript projects though. For example, 
 the axios library is a very popular library for sending 
 HTTP requests from the frontend.

In case you're working with such a library, instead of a 
global value, you can mock that library as you 
learned in the previous section (i.e., use vi.mock('axios'), 
provide a __mocks__/axios.js file if necessary etc.).
